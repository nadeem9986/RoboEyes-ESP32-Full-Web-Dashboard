   Project: RoboEyes Web UI (ESP32 Edition)
   Author: You
   Description:
   A fully web-controlled OLED eye animation system for ESP32
   using the FluxGarage RoboEyes library. This project replaces
   all physical buttons with a modern touchscreen UI accessible
   from any browser. Control moods, eye position, geometry,
   curiosity mode, flicker effects, cyclops mode, sweat/chill,
   and run animations – all in real time.

   Features:
   • Clean ESP32-hosted Web UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
   • Dark/Light mode toggle
   • Full mood control (Happy, Angry, Tired, Default)
   • 8-direction eye positioning + Center reset
   • NippleJS Joystick for live eye movement
   • Flicker effects (H/V) with amplitude sliders
   • Geometry shaping (width, height, radius, spacing)
   • Curiosity, Cyclops, and Sweat toggle modes
   • Built-in animations (laugh, confused, blink)
   • REST-style endpoints for every action

   Hardware:
   • ESP32 (Any Dev Board)
   • 128x64 SSD1306 OLED (I2C)
   • RoboEyes library by FluxGarage
   • WiFi AP/Router for browsing the UI

   Ideal For:
   • Robots, animatronics, mascots, cosplay helmets
   • Fun expressive robots without extra hardware buttons
   • Building polished UI-based robotics controls
